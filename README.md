The tasks I had to execute:
1.Proactive detection of fraud while answering following questions. <br>
2. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity. <br>
3. Trying various ML models on the final cleaned dataset. <br>
4. Demonstrate the performance of the model by using best set of tools. <br>
